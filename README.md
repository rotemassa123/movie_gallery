## Personal remarks
dear reader. there are some deviations and features i would have liked to add to my application, but were unable to due to time constraints. among them:
1. showcase only top-rated movies and not discovery movies (misunderstood the assignment)
2. testings
3. deployment
4. additional movie filters
5. UI improvements and feature addition (i.e sort movies by XYZ params)

Thank you for reading thus far and I hope u enjoy this application.
